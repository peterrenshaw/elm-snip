  A quickly written, hack tool for trying out elm code
  functions and data structures. 

  'cause I can't be bothered installing node.

* Programming Elm, P16
* working on:
- types
- type annotation
- saving old snippets as such

  SnippetYYYYMMDD.elm

* simplist idea I could think of
- we'll see with more complicated snippets if it works
* hack move passing back Debug.toString as text
- will show anything as text
- this should allow visible hacking of code w/o having to resort to 
  the full elm processing loop and init,model,view,update,subs

* wrote some docs.
* hack a quick tool to check elm code snippets
* example sources 
 
  https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/
  http://learnyouanelm.github.io/pages/02-starting-out.html

* this program uses elm-go, a simple shell script to compile the code
- you don't need it, but I get sick of typing in:

     elm make src/Main.elm 
     elm-format --yes src/Main.elm

- you can find it here:
