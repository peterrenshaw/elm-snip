  A quickly written, hack tool for trying out elm code
  functions and data structures. 

  'cause I can't be bothered installing node.

* Higher order functions
- Programming Elm, Ch1, P3,4,6,7,8,9 
- sayHello
- sayHigherOrder
- sayHigherOrder "Hi" "Elm"
- person "Jeremy" "Tucker"
- personHo "Jeremy" (\other -> sayHigherOrder "Hi" other) "Tucker"
- whatIsHigherOrderFunction "Higher Order Function"
- personHo "Jeremy" (\other -> other ++ ", how are you?") "Tucker"

* Currying

* Static Types, Type Annotation

* clean up
- must write a script that automates this
* I Want to capitalise words in a list
- then pass that function into map function to work on list of strings
- oh yeah... it works. See <https://github.com/peterrenshaw/elm-snip/blob/master/src/Snippet2019DEC11.elm>

2019DEC06
* Programming Elm, Ch1 P16
* working on:
- types
- type annotation
- saving old snippets as such

  SnippetYYYYMMDD.elm

* simplist idea I could think of
- we'll see with more complicated snippets if it works
* hack move passing back Debug.toString as text
- will show anything as text
- this should allow visible hacking of code w/o having to resort to 
  the full elm processing loop and init,model,view,update,subs

* wrote some docs.
* hack a quick tool to check elm code snippets
* example sources 
 
  https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/
  http://learnyouanelm.github.io/pages/02-starting-out.html

* this program uses elm-go, a simple shell script to compile the code
- you don't need it, but I get sick of typing in:

     elm make src/Main.elm 
     elm-format --yes src/Main.elm
